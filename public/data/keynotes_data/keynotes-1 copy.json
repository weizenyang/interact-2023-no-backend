It has a duty to each and every individual that it serves and must respect their human rights. At the same time, it has a wider social duty to promote equality through the services it provides and to pay particular attention to groups or sections of society where improvements in health and life expectancy are not keeping pace with the rest of the population.\nThe NHS just celebrated its 75th birthday and inclusivity of services has always been part of its design. In this keynote, Rochelle with discuss the origins and practice of inclusive design in the digital NHS space and the practical reality of strategically leading and delivering it."
