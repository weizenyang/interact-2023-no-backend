  "description": "The Interactive Demonstrations track is looking for examples of technological advances that can make human activities easier, faster, more accurate and less costly. We encourage demonstrations of new and emerging tools and technical solutions and innovations based on current solutions.\n\nWe are interested in demonstrations in the full range of HCI-related topics, especially related to the conference theme and topics (please consult the lists on the Full Paper and Short Paper pages).\n\nAn Interacitve Demonstration is a live presentation of a running system. Interactive Demos are curated. Submissions do not need to be anonymous.\n\nInteractive Demonstrations should be accompanied by an Extended Abstract which will be published in the INTERACT 2023 Conference proceedings.\n"
