  "description": "Panel discussions are discussions on current topics of interest among experts which then stimulate discussion with the audience. Individuals interested in organizing and chairing a panel on a topic that intrigues them may propose a Panel session. Topics that raise forward-looking or contentious issues and that will promote debate among panel members as well as audience involvement are strongly encouraged.\n\nAll suggestions will be assessed for topicality and ability to generate stimulating debate. Panels that include representatives of industry and academia are highly encouraged."
