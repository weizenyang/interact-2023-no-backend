How important is the output of this work in contributing to the identified problem or question? How greatly can others benefit from this work?\n\nOriginality: How novel is the contribution? How clearly does the submission communicate the ways that it differs from and goes beyond the most relevant previous work in this area? (Note that for a poster submission, full literature searches are not expected, although the most relevant citations should be included).\n\nValidity: How appropriate are the chosen methods for the work being undertaken? How well are the submission’s claims and conclusions supported by the results?\n\nWritten Presentation: How clear and understandable is the writing in the poster abstract? To what extent does the poster abstract conform to conference formatting requirements and the 4-page limit?\n\nVisual Presentation (The Poster): How well does the design of the poster effectively communicate the most important facets of the work? To what degree is the design of the poster likely to draw in an audience?\n\nAbility of the Work to Engender Discussion: To what degree will the presentation of this work stimulate interesting conversation among researchers or practitioners? To what extent will the presenters benefit from being able to discuss their work and receive feedback at this stage?\n\n**Upon Acceptance of your submission**\n\nIf a submission is accepted to appear at the conference, the contact person will receive further instructions regarding the inclusion of their poster abstract in the conference proceedings, as well as instructions for the poster presentation at the conference.\n\n**At the Conference**\n\nAccepted Posters will be displayed during the conference.

  "description": "Posters provide a unique opportunity to share valuable new ideas, eliciting useful feedback on early stage work, and foster discussions and collaborations among colleagues.\n\nA Poster is a concise report of recent findings or other types of innovative or thought-provoking work relevant to the INTERACT community.\n\nThe difference between Posters and other contribution types (e.g. Full or Short papers) is that Poster submissions represent work that has not reached a level of completion that would warrant the full refereed selection process. That said, appropriate submissions should contribute to the body of HCI knowledge, whether realized or promised.\n\nSummaries of completed work or reduced versions of short or full paper submissions are inappropriate as a Poster submission.\n\nSubmissions may include, but are not limited to, the following types of work:\n\n\n- Evaluations of systems, techniques, practices or other phenomena relevant to HCI.\n\n\n- description of new methods, processes, techniques, or tools for use in interactive system design, development or deployment.\n\n\n- Reflections from practice, including lessons learned or principles derived from real-world experiences and backed by thought-provoking and well-substantiated analyses.\n\n\n- Accounts of the design (rationale, process, outcomes and/or evaluation) of innovative applications, user interfaces, or systems.\n\nSubmissions for Posters are invited on any of the conference topics, please consult the examples provided in the Full and Short Paper submission details.\n\nPoster submissions should report original work and must not be under consideration for any other publication or have been published previously. \n"

  "description": "The Interactive Demonstrations track is looking for examples of technological advances that can make human activities easier, faster, more accurate and less costly. We encourage demonstrations of new and emerging tools and technical solutions and innovations based on current solutions.\n\nWe are interested in demonstrations in the full range of HCI-related topics, especially related to the conference theme and topics (please consult the lists on the Full Paper and Short Paper pages).\n\nAn Interacitve Demonstration is a live presentation of a running system. Interactive Demos are curated. Submissions do not need to be anonymous.\n\nInteractive Demonstrations should be accompanied by an Extended Abstract which will be published in the INTERACT 2023 Conference proceedings.\n"

Following are some examples of what may happen in workshops:\n\n\n- A traditional workshop with paper presentations, followed by forum discussions and a shared poster for presentation during the Workshops session in the main conference \n\n\n- An interactive event, where participants work together on experimenting with or evaluating an artifact, and make a video of the design or evaluation work highlights for presentation during the Workshops session in the main conference \n\n\n- A design workshop with focus on artefacts, with a gallery / showroom exhibition in the main conference \n\nOther, innovative formats of the workshop will also be of interest.\n\nWorkshops should have a minimum of 8 participants and a maximum of 30 participants. Workshops that do not reach the minimum number of participants may be subject to cancellation.\n\nA free workshop registration is granted to one of the workshop organizers if more than 10 participants are duly registered to the workshop.\nWorkshops will take place on 28 and 29 August 2023, immediately before the main conference.\n\nWorkshop Extended Abstract proposals should be formatted according to [Springer LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0). Authors should consult [Springer’s authors’ guidelines](ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/svproc/guidelines/Springer_Guidelines_for_Authors_of_Proceedings_CS.pdf) and use their proceedings templates, either for [LaTeX](https://www.interact2021.org/templates/llncs2e.zip) or for [Word](https://www.interact2021.org/templates/splnproc1703.zip), for the preparation of their papers.

It should cover the overall concept of the workshop including key organisers, objectives, theme/topic, target audience, and expected outcomes.\n\nWorkshop organization (1 page in any format): this will be internal for the reviewing process. It should cover the workshop duration and organisation (i.e. how will the organisers facilitate the workshop).\n\n\n**Publicising and Participating in a Workshop**\nEach accepted workshop will have its own call for participation and website.\nA schedule for paper submissions to each specific workshop will be advertised on due time.\nHow to submit a paper to a workshop will be decided by the workshop organizers (submission deadline will be no later than 1st June 2023).\n\nThe publication of papers accepted to the workshop will be decided, managed and edited by the workshop organisers.\n\n**Further Information**\nIf you require any further information please contact the Workshops CoChairs: Jan Stage and Anna Bramwell-Dicks\n\nE-mail: [workshops@interact2023.org](mailto:workshops@interact2023.org)",
