From Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam: 
Eurostar (www.eurostar.com) from Paris and Brussels to London (Kingâ€™s Cross-St Pancras) and then the East Coast line to York is a bit quicker and a lot more comfortable than flying the same route (the York HCI Group has done comprehensive evaluation of these routes and the train wins on time, comfort and carbon footprint). 

Booked in advance it is also not very expensive. 

Eurostar also has a service from Amsterdam, we have yet to evaluate this route.
