*Buses `66` / `67`*

Both run from the *Train Station* to *Campus East* (and beyond to the University Sport Centre).

Both buses pass through Campus West, get off at University Library for on-campus accommodation in James College or Franklin House.
Continue on to the Campus East stop for the conference venue.

`67` passes along Walmgate, where the Indigo Hotel is located.  There is a stop a very short walk from the hotel (turn right out of the hotel towards the walls)

`66` passes along Clifford St close to the Hilton Hotel (turn right out of the hotel and right again onto Clifford St).

`6` will also take you to Campus East (but not Campus West) but via a much longer route.

You can get on any bus between *Campus West* and *Campus East* for free.
