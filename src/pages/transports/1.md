__LBA, Leeds Bradford Airport__
(https://www.leedsbradfordairport.co.uk/)

____
Closest airport to York (approx. 50 minutes by road), a quick and small airport to travel through.

Flights to many European cities (Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Paris, Pisa, Prague, Rome, and Warsaw).

Served by numerous airlines including Aer Lingus, British Airways (for connections at
Heathrow), KLM (for connections at Schiphol), Ryan Air, and the home airport for Yorkshire's own low cost airline, Jet2.

Unfortunately, the direct coach service from LBA to York is currently discontinued. 

*Update*: You can take a bus into Leeds (the Flyer A1, check [*here*](https://flyerbytransdev.palisis.com/?offer-direct=r-5046)) and then the train to York. 

A taxi from the airport should be pre-booked and will cost about £65. We will see if we can arrange for people to share taxis if they are arriving (and departing) on the same flights or flights at similar times. If you are interested in this option (or need help booking a taxi for yourself) please complete this spreadsheet before August 21 and we will be in touch: [*Taxi Sharing List*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iBax_ew1dnE8QtvZD0KAAZBsPt-bBW7b6BX6f7Eo_3U/edit?usp=sharing)

(please contact Helen.Petrie@york.ac.uk for this option).

You can also take a bus/train combination (bus to Leeds Railway Station, then train to York) or a taxi (approximately £50 per taxi).
