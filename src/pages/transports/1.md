*LBA, Leeds Bradford Airport* (https://www.leedsbradfordairport.co.uk/)

 Closest airport to York (approx. 50 minutes by road), a quick and small airport to travel through.

Flights to many European cities (Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Paris, Pisa, Prague, Rome, and Warsaw).

Served by numerous airlines including Aer Lingus, British Airways (for connections at
Heathrow), KLM (for connections at Schiphol), Ryan Air, and the home airport for Yorkshire's own low cost airline, Jet2.

Unfortunately, the direct coach service from LBA to York is currently
discontinued. If the service is not reinstated by 2023, we will arrange shared transport
options for conference delegates from the airport direct to the University and central York

(please contact Helen.Petrie@york.ac.uk for this option).

You can also take a bus/train combination (bus to Leeds Railway Station, then train to York) or a taxi (approximately Â£50 per taxi).
