From London/Edinburgh: York is on the main line between London (Kings Cross-St Pancras, called the East Coast line) and Edinburgh, with an excellent service, about a train every 30 minutes. Fast trains from London take less than 2 hours, just over 2 hours from Edinburgh. It’s a very busy service, so it’s important to book a ticket a reasonable time in advance (a couple of weeks, when it is much cheaper than just walking up and buying a ticket) and get a free seat reservation. The services is run by two train companies (LNER – lner.co.uk; Grand Central - https://www.grandcentralrail.com/), but you can buy tickets for either on the LNER website (but you can’t change your ticket from one company to the other once you have booked it).
