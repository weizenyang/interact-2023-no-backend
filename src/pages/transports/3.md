*London Airports* (Gatwick and Heathrow in particular)

York is well connected with Gatwick airport near London. You can take a train to
London St Pancras from Gatwick and then just walk across the street and take the train to
York (for information about the King’s Cross to York train service, see below). 

It does take a bit of time, but you see the country and meet lots of people. Also very good facilities for a meal or snack at St Pancras/King’s Cross. 

Departures approximately every 30 minutes by two train companies (LNER – lner.co.uk; Grand Central - https://www.grandcentralrail.com/).

From Heathrow, take the Piccadilly Line of the Underground direct to King’s Cross – St
Pancras (one Underground station, two above ground stations, a bit confusing). Then take
the train to York (see below).
