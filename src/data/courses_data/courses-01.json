  "title": "Hacking the Brain - The Risks and Challenges of Cognitive Augmentation",
  "description": "There is a growing vision for augmentations that enhance cognitive capacities – extending our perception, enhancing our attentive capabilities, enriching our memories, and supporting higher order thinking (e.g., decision making). These tools will take a variety of forms, from the already ubiquitous smartphone, to the growing smart glasses landscape, and even implants. The idea that such augmentations may have unintended consequences or could be intentionally hijacked for harm is already present in popular culture – to what extent are such concerns grounded in reality? How might we identify potential harms and the circumstances in which they are amplified or reduced? What controls might reduce the risk of cognitive harm when technology is used to extend perception and intellect? In this course, we provide researchers with an overview of the research landscape for cognitive augmentation, provide some case studies of harms and the techniques used to measure them, and engage in some critical reflection on future controls (technical, social, political).",
