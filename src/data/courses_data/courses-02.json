  "title": "The UCD Sprint - Bringing users along to sprint",
  "description": "One of the most important aspects of software development is that the software is suitable for the intended users. Software professionals often tailor software development to their own needs, resulting in the software being unsuitable for many users. The course will introduce a User-Centered Design Sprint (UCD Sprint) process, which aims at extending the understanding of users' needs and wants. Participants will practice two steps from the UCD Sprint: the user group analysis and stating user experience goals. This in-person course appeals to researchers and developers interested in exploring their innovative ideas through a user-centred progressive and concise step-by-step process.",
