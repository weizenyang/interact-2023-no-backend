  "description": "This course provides a practical approach to ethical working with participants in HCI. Drawing from many years of experience of thinking and writing about ethical HCI with children, the course is set against a backdrop of ensuring that participants who work with our community feel valued and see the value in the work they contribute to. The course will offer – beyond the IRB / ethics review board – checklists and examples that will encourage a reflective participant-centred approach to participation to ensure that all those who work with us – whether as co-designers, evaluators or research participants get the most out of their participation in HCI activities.",
