  "description": "Thanks to advances in deep learning and powerful language models, conversational systems or devices enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) have become almost ubiquitous. Conversational AI found in voice assistants or chatbots, for example, is no longer restricted to smartphones or smart speakers but has come to be integrated in people’s homes, offices and cars. Apart from the benefits such as comfort and hands-free use, respective systems also raise challenges related to privacy, control, and smartness. Voice or human-like speech, in particular, is closely associated with most people’s perception of smartness. This hybrid workshop will explore different aspects of user-perceived smartness of conversational AI such as speech and emotion recognition or an understanding of context or user preferences."
