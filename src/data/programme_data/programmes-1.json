  "description": "This second workshop on HCI Engineering Education aims at carrying forward work on identifying, examining, structuring, and sharing educational resources and approaches to support the process of teaching/learning Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Engineering. The widening range of available interaction technologies and their applications in increasingly varied contexts (private or professional) underlines the importance of teaching HCI Engineering but also the difficulty of taking into account changes and developments in this field in often static university curricula. Besides, as these technologies are taught in diverse curricula (ranging from Human Factors and Psychology to hardcore Computer Science), we are interested in what the best approaches and best practices are to integrate HCI Engineering topics in the curricula of programs in Software Engineering, Computer Science, Human-computer Interaction, Psychology, Design, etc. The workshop is proposed on behalf of the IFIP Working Group 2.7/13.4 on User Interface Engineering."
