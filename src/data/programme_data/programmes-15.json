  "description": "In the midst of the world’s struggle to respond appropriately to the ongoing climate crisis, additional pressure mounts from other challenges such as economic turmoil and energy crises. While individuals are directly and severely affected by the consequences both short-term and long-term, there is still too much policy focus on consumer and individual led change. This workshop focuses on finding more impactful solutions by turning toward commercial, industrial, and organisational stakeholders in decision-making positions, using Net Zero as a lens to imagine future scenarios. This workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders to share their experience from past and ongoing work in this domain. Utilising guided co-design activities we envisage constructing future scenarios that build upon the participants’ expertise and offer avenues for how HCI research can help design solutions towards a more sustainable tomorrow."
