  "description": "Intelligence Augmentation (IA) has long been understood as a concept that describes how human capabilities are enhanced by technologies to improve their intelligence (often in a collective sense), and therefore improve the outcomes of many tasks. While IA’s goal is to keep the human in the loop and design technology around users, the future of IA as being universally beneficial for people has been widely questioned. As IA outputs are increasingly used to train Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI is used to enable IA, new questions arise around the implications of integrating IA systems in the real world. These concerns span from autonomous agency, to privacy and ethics, workers’ rights and the essence of ownership of cognitive output. This workshop seeks to explore the latest research on technologies and policies that allow IA to benefit individuals and groups, both in the private sphere and the workplace."
