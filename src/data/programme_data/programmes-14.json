  "description": "Current handheld displays, such as smartphones and tablets, can provide a wide and low budget access to augmented and mixed reality (AR/MR) applications. However, current research in this area faces many challenges, e.g., suitable interaction techniques, better user experience, navigation in MR environments, etc. These challenges limited the usage of AR/MR application in real world activities. Targeting these challenges, the ARM4HanD 20223 workshop will provide a platform for researchers, developers, and professionals to discuss issues and defining novel methods and approaches suitable for developing new interaction paradigms, user interfaces, 3D visualizations, and application for AR/MR in handheld display devices."
