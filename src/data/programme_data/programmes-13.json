  "description": "Maps, in their many forms, have long been used to guide and coordinate different human activities, ranging from local to global, and small scale to large scale. As such, maps continue to play a central role as the basis for a wide variety of interactive tools and applications in our modern digital age as well. This workshop aims to bring together researchers, designers and practitioners interested in maps and map-like visualizations as the underlying physical, theoretical, or metaphorical framework for designing interfaces and interactions. This workshop will create a common ground and a collaborative space for sharing design, research, and practical expertise to aid its participants with creating novel future map-based designs in different fields, including visualization, visual design, interaction design, user interface design, and cartography."
