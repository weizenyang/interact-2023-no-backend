  "description": "Sustainability is a multidimensional concept with dimensions intertwined. The field of sustainable HCI explores ways to design interactive systems in a more sustainable way and to make user behavior more sustainable. In addition, social justice and equity aspects became emergent domains in HCI during the last decade. To develop interactive systems for the workplace, research on Human Work Interaction Design integrated work analysis and interaction design methods from HCI. As little HWID research has so far addressed environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability, this workshop is an opportunity to start a discussion on the subject. This workshop on sustainable human-work interaction designs aims to (a) investigate processes and methods for creating sustainable designs and workplaces, (b) collect case studies that analyze experiences with introducing and learning from sustainability at work, and (c) formulate a research agenda for future work on sustainable human-work interaction designs. The target audience for the workshop is researchers and practitioners working on topics related to work analysis, interaction design, green IT, digital transformation, slow design, craft design, system-organization fit, organizational implementation, benefits realization, and in-the-wild evaluation."
