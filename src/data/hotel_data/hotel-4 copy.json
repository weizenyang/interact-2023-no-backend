  "description" : "There are many B&Bs in York, please explore for yourself.  Bear in mind that the University is due east of the town centre, so staying north or west will increase your travel time. <br><br> There is also accommodation available at the University at Franklin House (Note this accommodation is on Campus West, so about 20 minutes walk to the conference venue, or you can use the free bus shuttle, free bikes or scooters) <br><br> Franklin House: https://www.stem.org.uk/about-us/venue-hire/franklin-house",
