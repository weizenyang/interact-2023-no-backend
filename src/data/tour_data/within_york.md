*Walk the walls:*

York’s medieval City Walls (or “Bar Walls”), a scheduled ancient monument encircling the historic City of York, comprise 3.4km (2 miles) of surviving masonry. 

They are the longest town walls in England. They were built mainly in the 13th century of limestone.The Walls offer a splendid elevated walk around the city. You can walk all the way around York, or just a section.

*Visit The Shambles and the medieval streets of York*

The Shambles is one of York's most famous landmarks and one of the best-preserved medieval shopping streets in Europe. With its cobbled streets and overhanging buildings, it is believed to have been the inspiration behind Diagon Alley from the movie adaptation of the Harry Potter series (apparently this is completely untrue, but doesn’t stop thousands of visitors taking photos on the assumption that it is true!).

*A fun way to walk around medieval York is to follow the Lucky Cat Trail*

Cats have played a part in York’s history and luck has been linked with them since records began. Cats always land on their feet and having nine lives is a piece of luck that we can all relate to. Statues of cats have been placed on buildings in York for around two centuries, although statues since removed or rotted are thought to date from medieval times.

*The Minster*

One of the largest cathedrals in Northern Europe, a beautiful Gothic church, its Great East Window (finished 1408) is the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the world. Built in top of the Roman basilica, the remains of which you can tour as part of your visit. 

It’s expensive to enter, but a guided tour is included, so it is good value for money and a wonderful building to see.
