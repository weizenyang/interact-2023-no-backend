*Whitby*

Historic town on the Yorkshire Coast. Famous for the ruins of Whitby Abbey and the Captain Cook Memorial Museum (of interest particularly to Australians and New Zealanders!).  Also  for the place to eat fish and chips (particularly at the Magpie Café).

Magnificent country house and gardens, still owned by the Howard family
(if you remember “Brideshead Revisited” the television series, it was Brideshead Castle in that series).
15 miles east of York.  There is a bus service from York: https://www.transdevbus.co.uk/york/services/YCD/CAS

*Yorkshire Dales National Park*

Beautiful country area to the west of York.  Famous for its moors (e.g. Ilkley Moor), Malham Cove and waterfalls.  Lots of walking, lots of sheep.
